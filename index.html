      <p><b>Hi! I'm Marla.  </b> I'm 30, and have thus far have had a wide variety of experiences in my life. I love to travel and explore other cultures, hike, practice yoga, milk goats, and garden. Just recently, I spent the last two years in India studying Ashtanga Yoga and Tibetan Buddhism, and dabbling in learning basic Tibetan language. Here I was able to volunteer with a drug rehab center for refugees.  I was inspired by seeing some of the work my friends did helping NGOs in the area with making websites to help locals. I would like to be able to make really awesome websites for other people one day, and help people put their visions into reality on the internet.

     <h2 align="center">The Farm</h2>
        <p>Years ago, I purchased a small property in rural Oregon.  Here I learned a lot about building, fencing, and such as I sustained myself on the food I was growing.  I raised some dairy goats, chickens, pigs, and lots of vegetables.  This experience taught me a lot about self-reliance and problem solving. </p>
     <h2 class="textcenter">India</h2>
        <p>I went to India to go to my teacher's teacher in Mysore to study Ashtanga yoga.  Luckily I wound up in a meditation retreat in the Himalayas.  Here I decided to continue studies and live.  I spent much of the first year in meditation retreats.  Later I ended up studying Tibetan language and teaching yoga for a drug rehab for Tibetan refugees.  I was even lucky enough to meet the <em>Dalai Lama</em> here.  This experience taught me a lot about myself and how my mind works.  I think I developed a bit more patience, and hopefully I am a kinder person today as I continue to practice what I began learning here.
